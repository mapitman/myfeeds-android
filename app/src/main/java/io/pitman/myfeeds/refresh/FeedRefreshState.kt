/**
 * App-wide "a feed refresh is currently running" signal (issue #152), shared between the manual
 * pull-to-refresh path ([io.pitman.myfeeds.feedlist.FeedListViewModel]) and the scheduled
 * background worker ([FeedRefreshWorker]) -- unread counts are displayed frozen while this is
 * true, so a scheduled background refresh needs to participate too, not just a manual one, or
 * counts still visibly flicker whenever the background worker happens to fire.
 *
 * A reference count rather than a plain boolean, so an overlapping manual refresh and background
 * refresh don't let one's completion prematurely flip this back to "not refreshing" while the
 * other is still writing to the DB.
