/**
 * Ported from MyFeeds.Data/FeedDataContext.cs FeedItem table. `id` is a client-generated UUID
 * (matches the original's `UniqueIdentifier` PK); dedup on ingest is by `itemGuid` (fallback
 * chain guid -> id -> link, applied in the feed update engine, not here).
 *
 * `enclosureRequestId` (a WP BackgroundTransferService request id) has no Android equivalent and
 * isn't persisted -- WorkManager tracks its own requests, looked up by this row's [id] instead.
 * `downloadedBytes`/`downloadedFilePath` (issue #23) replace the original's runtime-only
 * `EnclosureBytesDownloaded`/`IsEnclosureDownloading`: they need to be persisted here since
 * Android downloads happen in a background worker, not a live in-memory transfer the UI already
 * holds a reference to.
