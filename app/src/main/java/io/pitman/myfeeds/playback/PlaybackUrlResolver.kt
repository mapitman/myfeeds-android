 * downloaded episode plays from local storage regardless of the streaming setting; anything else
 * falls back to the remote enclosure URL, gated by [allowStreaming]. Local-file download tracking
 * doesn't exist yet in this port (issue #23), so [downloadedFilePath] is always null today -- this
 * resolver already supports it so the playback service doesn't need to change when #23 lands.
